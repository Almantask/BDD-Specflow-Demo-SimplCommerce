# Change shopping cart item quantity

As a shopper
I would like to be able to change quantity of shopping cart items
So that I can choose how many items I want to buy without going back to a shop.

## Acceptence criteria

- Decrement quantity by 1
- Increment quantity by 1
- Edit quantity directly

## Comments

- Editing quantity directly could be done in a text box.
- Decrementing and incrementing will probably require a +- button each.
